comfortable working around it.
</h4><p>We get better tech every decade. Assembly was 10x better than machine language.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-generation_programming_language . Procedural Algol programming
was 10X better than Assembly. Organizations were compelled to upgrade to avoid extinction. Every
10 years we get more abstract. Today, Word Press(WP) and LAMP (Linux OS, Apache HTTPServer, MySQL DB and PHP )
are dominant, vast majority of Web runs LAMP. But... we had about 10 years of WP/LAMP. Will you convert? Ans:
You won't have a choice. Here is the incremental things that add up to 10X.
</p><h3>Static files marked up in Cloud with API. New can be scary.</h3><p>- Instead of DB based, File based, hosted on S3 Cloud.
S3 easily hosts petabytes, for WWW scale. But that is not the main benefit. When hosting in DB, you create tables
that point to images, that are stored as files. It is very easy to lose the pointing to the media file, so the
system loses track of images. We have all seen image missing error messages, common for LAMP.
So instead of just storing images and media in a page's folder - staticgen.com has a text file called meta that stores
DB fields, similar to how we store RSS. Because the page folder contains media and data fields, bitrot is eliminated, and
cost of maintenance is significantly reduced. Do you relay want to mitigate security at container level? So instead of LAM of LAMP, we have Cloud and S3.

You upload (such as FTP) you html folder to S3 that have pages and media plus data fields. No DB.
No http server. No operating system. 10X less security managmnet.
</p><h3>No HTML! Default markup for Node HTTP servers such as 'Express' is not HTML.
</h3><p>Remember HTML? You'd write it in PHP, JSP, ASP, Grails, Rails, Django, etc. Even editors using WP
Admin tool would write HTML. Opening and closing tags in WP. You are open to not close a tag properly
or not nest properly. Lots of pain was had by all.
An incremental approval was Markdown. If you have used Git, you must have used markdown. It is a way to generate safe
HTML. Most CMS today use Markdown. But it was limited in layout. So most CMS have a few layouts, the age of WP.
So we need a safe auto closing version of Markdown, full Markup that is not limited in any way.
Pug.
Default for Node HTTP Servers such as 'Express' is Pug.
Pug generates full HTML. But with auto nesting and auto closing. It is a easier higher level abstraction.
Most people know some HTML, and this is just an easy/auto version of HTML. Auto-closing is like automatic memory management,
something that once was done by programmers - and it was error prone. And it limited the complexity
of business solutions, since you had to focus on memory management. It was a thing.
We even eschew javascript, programming is considered harmful.

So we use Pug as Declarative Language. Just like SQL is declarative - you say what you want. Just like HTML is declarative,
you say what you want it to look like. Those are 3 declarative languages. Older languages such as Algol based are
procedural or functional, for example Java or JavaScript. They are not declarative, like Pug.

These two things are main tenets of the modern statically generated approach
</p><h3> Server-less, Baas, API. So no DB is not an issue when you create a dynamic WebApp, because you are server-less. API's and</h3><p>Miro-services are a thing!
For example, AWS Cognito is an cost effective API based Auth service. There are many micro-services and apis.
You can search for some of the APIs at programmableweb.com. So this last one is the very disruptive, and
a bit hard to grasp: you don't need back end or even full stack programmers. 0. You are server-less .
Worst case you write a bit of Lambda - that auto scales.
</p><h3>No Photoshop.</h3><p>Experiment, being able to create a study project rapid enough. Before a graphic artist
would create a prototype that is not 'HTML', and hand over to a developer. No more. We will
show you a different way.
</p><p>- Native mobile first, in Pug. No IOS or Android development is needed.
PhoneGap and Cordova compilers have advanced, they now compile a faster WebKit. It can be as easy as clicking a button
to deploy to IOS and Andorid app stores, without installing XCode or Android SDK. There are even reflex based games
written in Cordova (HTML/Pug), that is how fast it is, 30FPS and faster. No need to believe this, when you can
test it. (OK, yes, there are some old devices with old CPU running old versions of OS, but then again, there
is IE11 and we work around that)

Will people still look for way to use old ways? Yes, people still look for how to use Minicomputers.</p><h2>So, how should you use 10X? First, no lock in.</h2><img class="ui medium left floated image" src="flipboard.jpg"><p>10X means that you can do things in 4 hours, what used to take 2 weeks. A prediction is that you won't use the time
to do more, but you'll use time to do better. People will make webapps that are more interactive, more engaging:
Webapps will be used to tell the story better.

For example, there will be more gesture based apps, like FlipBoard or Tinder. Do you like that effect of using
FlipBoard, and the page folds? Yeah, we show you how to do that.

Also, 4 day work week is a thing.

</p><h3>Here is how to get started, what are the options:</h3><p>- Check out sample app on S3

- Take a 'train the trainer' online instructor lead training

- Develop a sample app by reading a tutorial

- Deploy a sample app to your S3
</p><h3>Offerings/ agency consulting pacakges</h3><p>Best practices assement
2 week engagment to interview and present. ~ $20K
</p><p>Gradual migration
We help you gradualy migrate from exisiting platform.
We do that in two steps:
	Step 1: integrateing a few new modules into your website
webapp.
	Step 2: Then flip the switch, the ew platfrom integrates your old modules and mentor the staff. So everything new
	is on the new platofrm.
</p><p>Fix exissting project.
It takes about a day per screen/page, so you should get a few pages/screens done per week, ~ $3K / screen/page to migrate.


</p><p>Hosting.
Our hosting is different. Becuase you host on your S3. We support you. Better yet
that you have your own webmaster. In this case, we support him
her.
Other hosting: on their server. We just support you on your S3.
</p><p>Consulting
Our consulting is different. We mentor YOUR team. Better yet, we do train the trainer of your tech manager.
</p><p>Work with an Agency
When working w/ an agency, we work heads down code, or as a tech lead.
</p><p>- Open source nbake is free

- The paid training class is held online every 2 weeks, $150 for two sessions
</p><p>Our target is lead designers who:
	A. work on websites and webapps that matter, ie work on cool stuff
	B. designers who code.
</p><p>API: we offer api to build in cloud. By calling our api we build on yourS3. $10 / month.
And admin screen.</p><p>Join/Sign up to get in touch with us.</p></div><!--FOOTER - nested--><!-- footer--><p></p><div class="ui inverted vertical footer segment"><div class="ui container"><div class="ui stackable inverted divided equal height stackable grid"><div class="three wide column"><h4 class="ui inverted header">Services</h4><div class="ui inverted link list"><a class="item" href="#">Free and open source</a><a class="item" href="#">Instructor training</a></div></div><div class="three wide column"><h4 class="ui inverted header">Contacts</h4><div class="ui inverted link list"><a class="item" href="#">Meta Forum<a class="item" href="/page/about">About</a></a></div></div><div class="seven wide column"><h4 class="ui inverted header">Our Mission:</h4><p>We get better tech every decade.
